        Gatsby’s rich data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data
        you want — from one or many sources: Pull data from headless CMSs, SaaS
        services, APIs, databases, your file system, and more directly into your
        pages using GraphQL.

      <>
        Gatsby.js is Internet Scale. Forget complicated deploys with databases
        and servers and their expensive, time-consuming setup costs,
        maintenance, and scaling fears. Gatsby.js builds your site as “static”
        files which can be deployed easily on dozens of services.

      <>
        Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code
        and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML,
        CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once
        loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around
        the site feels incredibly fast.
